# 3.1 Template Model

The following sections contain details on the construction of the cells
and circuits in HNN's canonical **neocortical template model**
(comprised of a layered cortical column) as well as exogenous driving
inputs. Each section details the parameters that can currently be
adjusted in the HHN-GUI for the user's hypothesis testing needs. If
there are parameters you would like to be able to adjust in the HNN-GUI
but cannot, we encourage you to submit suggestions to our [Github issues
page](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn/issues).

While the adjustable parameters in the HNN-GUI are necessarily limited,
all parameters and network configurations can be changed based on your
hypothesis testing goals using NEURON-Python code in our documented and
supported [HNN-Core repository
page](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core). Please see
the ["Getting Started"](https://hnn.brown.edu/getting-started/) page
for more details on the functionality of HNN-GUI and HNN-Core, and how
more specialized neocortical template models can be used and developed.
