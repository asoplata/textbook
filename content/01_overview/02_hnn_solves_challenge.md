Following quotes from https://hnn.brown.edu/getting-started/ :

- "Importantly, HNN was created to be a hypothesis development and testing tool."

- “Our goal is not to promote singular theories on the origin of any particular signal, but rather to provide a tool based on known biophysics and training resources where researchers can develop testable predictions on the neural origin of their data”
